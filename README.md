# get foamy

These are my dotfiles. The configuration of the multiverse in which I type. I journeyed long to arrive at this set of configs. It isn't done yet, but
it's better than it used to be. You probably shouldn't adopt these methods, as they're very opinionated. But if you're interested, running `./link`
will back up all your old configs and replace them with these. Tread cautiously, as I haven't yet written `./unlink`.
